## Admin

The router protects every `/admin` child route with the admin session guard. Main workflows are:

- Tenant list and tenant detail
- SML connection and safe connection test
- Recipient invitation, status, report permissions, and permission dependencies
- LINE schedule creation/editing, preview, activation, pause, test send, archive, and restore
- Global report run, LINE delivery, and audit views
- Operational incident list/detail with safe references, evidence timeline, acknowledge, and accepted-risk closure

The App shell polls the open P1 count at most once per minute while the tab is
visible. The incident detail page may resolve authenticated tenant names, but
the copy-for-Codex summary contains only safe operational fields. Admin cannot
manually mark an incident recovered: Acknowledge stops reminders, and accepted
risk is a separate closure with a required reason.

Report Run history shows a persisted Thai failure summary without loading one
detail request per table row. `ดูสาเหตุและหลักฐาน` lazily loads the selected run
and separates confirmed stage/transport evidence from possible checks. It must
not claim that a customer Server is down or a Firewall blocked traffic without
direct evidence, and opening the detail must never test SML automatically.

Incident list defaults to active episodes and leads with Thai cause, area to
inspect, active impact, and local time rather than raw codes. Continuous
conditions say `ตรวจพบต่อเนื่อง` instead of displaying probe counts. The detail
page loads bounded occurrences separately from the incident summary and may show
a sanitized historical/current JavaWS URL only to an authenticated Admin.
Opening that URL is explicitly different from the guarded Server Dashboard
connection test; neither action runs automatically and a successful test never
marks the scheduled incident recovered. The timeline may show tenant/report
context and a causal chain, while technical fields remain collapsed.
Copy-for-Codex excludes tenant names, tenant IDs, endpoints, KPI, SQL,
credentials, and raw payloads.

Permission and schedule selection are different concepts:

- Permission = reports a recipient may open in the tenant dashboard.
- Schedule report set = reports included in one LINE occurrence.
- Every selected recipient must have permission for every report selected by an active schedule.

## Admin Table Navigation

- Admin history tables use server-side filtering and bounded cursor pagination;
  changing filters resets the cursor chain and aborts obsolete requests.
- Recipient tables return an exact filtered total for PrimeVue pagination. Search,
  status, and permission filters are evaluated before paging, while selections
  outside the visible page remain intact.
- Schedule tables filter by name, lifecycle status, and archived visibility on
  the server. Selecting `ARCHIVED` explicitly enables archived rows.
- Small catalog/picker tables use local PrimeVue filtering and 25/50/100-row
  pagination because their full bounded catalogs are already in browser memory.
- Every table keeps numeric/action/select alignment semantics and must preserve
  loading, empty, denied, and error states at mobile and desktop widths.

## Viewer Entry

`ViewerShell.vue` initializes the viewer session, resolves invitation or delivery entry references, loads accessible tenants, and establishes navigation scope.

### `/app`

- Zero accessible tenants: show an empty state.
- One accessible tenant: may open it automatically.
- Multiple accessible tenants: show the chooser; do not select the first tenant silently.
- A tenant membership with no report permissions remains visible with an explanatory state.

### Tenant scope

Routes:

```text
/app/tenant/{tenantId}
/app/tenant/{tenantId}/report/{reportKey}
```

The menu is built from the current tenant report permissions. An explicit malformed or unauthorized tenant route becomes unavailable and must not display stale data from a previous tenant.

### Delivery scope

Routes:

```text
/app/tenant/{tenantId}/delivery/{deliveryId}
/app/tenant/{tenantId}/delivery/{deliveryId}/report/{reportKey}
```

The menu is built only from `DeliveryContext.reports`, preserving delivery order. It must not flash the wider tenant menu while context loads. A report absent from the delivery is rejected even when the recipient may open it in tenant scope. `ไป Dashboard ร้าน` exits delivery scope explicitly.

## Fail-closed Rules

- Clear previous tenant name, menus, KPI, charts, and delivery context before validating a new explicit route.
- Abort obsolete requests and use a generation/current-context guard before applying responses.
- Use the same generic unavailable message for missing and unauthorized resources.
- Recovery returns to `/app` only after the user requests it.
- Delivery routes load existing snapshots and never start report runs or revalidation automatically.
